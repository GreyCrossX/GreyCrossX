## 🚀 Featured Projects

### ⚡ **2m2 — Multi-Service Crypto Trading Infrastructure**
A production-style trading architecture with:
- High-frequency market data ingestion (Redis Streams)
- Async calculation services (SMA, regime detection, ARM/DISARM signals)
- Order execution workflows integrated with Binance USDS Futures
- Strong separation of services using clean architecture principles

**Impact:** Designed for real-time, reliable execution and scalable experimentation.

### 📚 **LexToolkit — AI Research Engine for Lawyers**
A legal-tech platform for automating research across Mexican federal & CDMX legislation:
- Custom scrapers for legislation with OCR fallback
- Domain-aware chunking (article, paragraph, fraction-level)
- Vector storage (pgvector) + retrieval pipelines
- Agent workflows (classification, summarization, legal Q/A)

**Impact:** Enables faster, structured legal research using AI and NLP.

## 🎯 What I'm Working On Now
- Improving system design & backend architecture skills (CQRS, DDD, event-driven patterns)
- Developing more scalable agent pipelines with LangGraph  
- Enhancing my trading infra with better caching, monitoring, and orchestration  
- Preparing for backend SWE interviews (SQL, system design, auth)
