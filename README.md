# 👋 Hi, I'm Miguel Athie (GreyCross)
**Backend Engineer | Distributed Systems | AI Orchestration**
📍 Based in Mexico | 🇪🇸 **EU Citizen (Spanish)** | 🇲🇽 **Mexican Citizen**
*Zero-friction hire for US/LATAM (Nearshore) and EU (Remote) markets.*

---

## 🚀 The Mission
I build production-ready backend systems where high-performance engineering meets intelligent automation. With 3-4 years of experience, I specialize in moving data at scale (Go/Redis) and building autonomous reasoning loops (Python/LangGraph).

**Current Focus:** Migrating high-throughput logic from Python to **Go** to optimize concurrency and cloud costs while scaling AI agent architectures.

## 🛠️ Technical Arsenal

| Category | Technologies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **High Performance** | **Go (Golang)**, Python (AsyncIO), C (Specialist contexts) |
| **Data & Messaging** | PostgreSQL (pgvector), Redis (Streams/Caching), gRPC, RabbitMQ |
| **AI & Agents** | LangChain, LangGraph, RAG Pipelines, Embedding Models |
| **Cloud & DevOps** | Docker, AWS (EC2/S3), GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Clean Architecture |

## 🏗️ Featured Engineering Projects


### ⚡ [2m2](https://github.com/GreyCrossX/2m2) | **Python • Redis Streams • Binance API**
*Production-style trading infrastructure focused on async performance.*
- Implemented **Clean Architecture** to separate market ingestion, signal detection, and order execution.
- Used **Redis Streams** for fault-tolerant message passing between microservices.
- Designed for sub-second signal-to-execution latency in USDS Futures markets.

### 📚 [LexToolkit](https://github.com/GreyCrossX/LexToolkit) | **LLMs • Vector DB • NLP**
*AI Research Engine for Mexican and Spanish Legislation.*
- Built custom scrapers with **OCR fallback** to digitize unstructured legal PDFs.
- Engineered a **domain-aware chunking strategy** (Art/Para level) resulting in 30% higher retrieval accuracy.
- Automated complex legal Q&A using multi-step agent workflows.

---

## 📈 System Metrics & Impact
- **Performance:** Reduced API response times by ~40% by implementing AsyncIO and strategic Redis caching.
- **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime on personal trading infra through robust error-handling and automated health checks.
- **Efficiency:** Migrated heavy data processing tasks to Go, reducing RAM usage by 60% compared to equivalent Python scripts.

## 🎯 What I'm Looking For
I am seeking **Backend-leaning Fullstack** or **Distributed Systems** roles within:
- **Fintech/Trading:** High-concurrency systems and execution logic.
- **AI Infrastructure:** Building the "pipes" that make LLMs useful at scale.
- **European/US Startups:** Leveraging my dual citizenship for remote-first teams.
